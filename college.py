"""US Dept. of Education — College Scorecard retrieval.

Colleges and universities (mostly nonprofit, and core TechSoup customers) — tuition,
enrollment, admission and completion rates, net price. Keyed by school NAME (the API does
its own fuzzy matching), so no spine resolution is needed. Fields come back as flat dotted
keys (e.g. "latest.cost.tuition.out_of_state"), which is what the leaf pins.
