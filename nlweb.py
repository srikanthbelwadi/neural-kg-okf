"""The NLWeb protocol, spoken over the Neural KG engine.

This is the ONLY query contract the server offers. The engine's own shape — a synthesized answer
plus the table it came from — maps onto NLWeb's message stream without inventing anything:

    begin-nlweb-response   the query started
    intermediate_message   the play-by-play (discovery, plan, resolve, fetch, acceptance check)
    result                 the ARD candidate tables, as NLWeb Items
    nlws                   {"@type": "GeneratedAnswer", "answer": …, "items": […]}
    complete / end-nlweb-response

An OKF **source** is an NLWeb **site** — both name "the corpus a result came from" — so `?site=`
filters discovery to those sources, exactly as `sites=` does upstream. An OKF **table** is an
NLWeb **Item**: its `schema_object` is the descriptor's own frontmatter, which is the closest
thing this system has to structured data about a result, because it is literally that.

Request (GET or POST /ask): query, site, mode, max_results, min_score, streaming, sse_format,
conversation_id, on_ambiguity, assumptions, debug. Streaming is the default; `streaming=false`
returns one JSON document of the same messages, which is what upstream does. `assumptions` is a
JSON object either way: a GET client sends it encoded, since a query string has no nested objects.
