# Query

Each table is reached with the `get` operation. The leaf entry pins the dataset
`path`; the caller supplies `query` — a URL query string (`fields=`, `filter=`,
`sort=` with `-` for descending, `page[size]=`, `page[number]=`). For the most
recent value, `sort=-record_date&page[size]=1` and read the leaf's key field.

Responses are `{ "data": [ ... ] }`; the records are in `data`.

# Matching & caveats

- **The API does not default to the most recent record.** Without
  `sort=-record_date&page[size]=1` you get an arbitrary (typically oldest) page,
  so a "current" figure must always sort descending by `record_date` and take one
  row. Report that `record_date` as the as-of date.
- **Multi-series tables need a `filter` or the answer is an arbitrary series.**
  Several datasets stack many series in one table — exchange rates carry one row
  per currency per quarter, and the debt tables separate public vs.
  intragovernmental holdings. The leaf pins a filter using
  `field:eq:value` syntax (e.g. `country_currency_desc:eq:Euro Zone-Euro`).
  Dropping it silently returns whichever series happens to sort first.
- **Exchange rates are quarterly reporting rates, not live market rates**, and
  are expressed as *units of foreign currency per US dollar* — the reciprocal of
  the direction people often assume.
- All values arrive as **JSON strings**, not numbers; convert before arithmetic.
- This source is keyed by **date, not by an entity** — there is no company,
  place, or organization to resolve.
