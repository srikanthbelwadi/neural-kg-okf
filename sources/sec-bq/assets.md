title: Total Assets by company — SEC financials (BigQuery)
description: Total Assets measures the overall value of all assets owned by SEC-reporting
  public companies, providing a comprehensive view of their financial strength. This
  measure specifically pertains to the population of SEC-reporting public companies,
  allowing for ranking, filtering, and counting based on total assets. It is distinct
  from other financial measures as it focuses solely on assets, excluding liabilities
  or equity. The reporting is done per organization for each fiscal year.
