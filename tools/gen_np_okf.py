"""Generate per-field OKF leaf entries for IRS Form 990 nonprofit financials.

The 990 has a bounded, curated set of headline numeric fields (unlike the ~8.5k
XBRL taxonomy), so we hand-map the meaningful ones. One OKF leaf per field, keyed
by EIN at query time (the organization is a parameter). Each leaf cross-links to
nonprofit-990/_access.md for the query mechanics.
