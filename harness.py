# API (GET /agents, GET /agents/entry, POST /explore) exactly as searching it does. An earlier cut
# read registry/meta.json directly from here; it worked, but it quietly made the browser a special
# case that reached around the very interface being demonstrated.

<h1>How it works</h1>
<p class="sub">Describe each dataset once; discover it by meaning; fetch from the source at
question time. <a href="./">‹ back</a></p>

<h2>Control flow</h2>
<p>One question moves through six steps. Each can send it back a step, which is why a wrong
first guess degrades into a slower answer instead of a wrong one.</p>
<pre>question
  │
  ├─ classify    what entity, what measure, what SHAPE (point, ranking, ratio, timeseries…)
  ├─ discover    ARD: embed the question, retrieve candidate tables, re-rank them
  ├─ plan        does a candidate's declared capability support that shape?
  │                 no  → refuse here, before any request is made
  ├─ fetch       one generic accessor fills the URL template from the OKF descriptor
  ├─ check       is this record actually about what was asked?
  │                 no  → backtrack: next table, next entity, next period
  └─ synthesize  answer grounded in the returned record, quoting its figure and source</pre>
<p>The planning step is the unusual one. A source that lists one nonprofit's grants can compare
two named organizations but cannot rank the whole population — so a ranking question over it is
refused, not approximated. Refusing costs one classification; guessing costs credibility.</p>

<h2>Data flow</h2>
<p>Nothing is ingested. The only thing this system stores is <em>descriptions</em>:</p>
<pre>OKF descriptors  ──embed──▶  ARD index     (~10,400 tables, ~60 MB of vectors)
                                  │
question ─────────────────────────┘  picks ONE table
                                  │
                                  ▼
                        the source's own API  ──▶  answer
                        (SEC, Census, Treasury, CDC, IRS, …)</pre>
<p>The record that answers your question is fetched from the publisher, in that moment, and
discarded. There is no copy to refresh and no schema to migrate. Adding a source means adding a
folder with a Markdown file in it — no per-source query code.</p>

<h2>Why not a warehouse</h2>
<p>The usual approach — Data Commons, a lakehouse, any central warehouse — normalizes many
sources into one schema and loads the data into one place. That buys real things: arbitrary joins,
fast aggregates, one query language. It costs real things too.</p>
<table>
<tr><th></th><th>Warehouse / Data Commons</th><th>This</th></tr>
<tr><td>Unit of work</td><td>a pipeline per source</td><td>a description per source</td></tr>
<tr><td>Schema</td><td>normalize everything up front</td><td>keep each source's own</td></tr>
<tr><td>Data location</td><td>copied into the centre</td><td>stays at the publisher</td></tr>
<tr><td>Freshness</td><td>as of the last load</td><td>as of the request</td></tr>
<tr><td>Adding a source</td><td>model it, map it, backfill it</td><td>write one document</td></tr>
<tr><td>Good at</td><td>joins and aggregates over everything</td><td>breadth, currency, provenance</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bad at</td><td>long tail — the 8,000th field is never worth a pipeline</td><td>cross-source joins, population scans</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The trade is deliberate. Normalization is what makes the long tail unaffordable: nobody funds a
pipeline for the 8,096th us-gaap concept, so it never arrives. A description is cheap enough to
write for all of them, which is why this covers ~10,400 measures rather than a curated few.</p>
<p>The cost is equally real. Cross-source joins are the warehouse's home ground and this system's
weak spot, and questions over a whole population need a source that can scan one — which is
exactly what the planner checks before it answers.</p>

<h2>The exception that shows the rule</h2>
<p>One source is not live: the IRS 990 grant graph, ~7.8 M funder→recipient edges. The IRS
publishes no query API for it, only bulk filings, so there is nothing to call at question time and
the edges are built once into a database. Every other source stayed live because its publisher
offered a way to ask.</p>

<p class="note">Descriptors are <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/tree/main/okf">OKF</a>
documents; discovery speaks <a href="https://agenticresourcediscovery.org/">ARD</a>; the query
interface is <a href="https://github.com/nlweb-ai/NLWeb">NLWeb</a>.
<a href="ard">Browse the descriptors ›</a></p>
<p class="note">This page is the overview. <a href="life-of-a-query">The life of a query ›</a>
follows one question all the way through — every branch, every backtrack, and where the boundary
of what can be asked actually falls.</p>
